# Careful: there is a callback called when the IDB is closed or when we connect
# to the server so the netnode is recreated if idarling is running which we want 
# to avoid. 
# A workaround is to temporarily disable idarling by removing the plugin so it
# does not load to avoid the netnode to be recreated but it is annoying.
# A better way is to set IDAUSR to a path that does not exists so no plugin is loaded
# see ida_noplugin.bat
